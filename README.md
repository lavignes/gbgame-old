This is an unnamed WIP Game Boy Color game.

It uses my own [AZ65 assembler](https://github.com/lavignes/az65).

To build, you'll need AZ65. The easiest way to get it is through Cargo.

* Install Cargo with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
* Install AZ65:
  ```
  cargo install az65
  ```
* Then build:
  ```
  cd src && make
  ```
